        <h3>Emmalee</h3>
        <p>Emmalee is a 28 year old, stay at home mother of 4 children. The oldest is a 7 year old boy, next a 5 year old girl and last twin boys
            age 3. Emmalee home schools her children and is always on the look out for outdoor PE activities. She also wants to find
            activities where her children can interact with other kids their ages. She also would not be dissapointed to find other 
            women that are in a similar situation to her. Her boys are gifted at finding mud and bathing in it so she would like to know 
            ahead of time if she should bring extra towels. A precipitation forcast for the area is a must. She is always on the go so 
            she will most likely be viewing the page from her phone.
        </p>
        <h3>Cullen</h3>
        <p>Cullen is a single 32 year old male. He is new to the area and was drawn here by the vast array of available outdoor activities.
            He likes to be prepared and so he plans his activities ahead of time.  He will most likely be viewing the site from his laptop
            but will also need to be able to access it from his phone while he is out and about.  There is not much that will keep Cullen 
            indoors and so weather reports are a must. He also is affraid of lightning so he will want ot know if there have been any sightings in the area.
        </p>
