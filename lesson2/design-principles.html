            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>

            <p> The Apple brand is known for its minimalistic design. This trend is embraced in the Apple website as well. 
                The site has an abundance of White Space in an effort to draw the eye to one main image or text. 
                When the main image or subject changes the color of the White Space shifts in order to alert the viewer 
                that the new section referances a different subject or product.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h3>Target</h3>

            <p> This image shows the results of a search for women's shoes on the Target mobile website. Once the 
                search is complete several pictures appear to help you filter through the over 350 returned results. 
                Not only does Target give you more filters to simplify your choices as Hick's Law suggests, 
                but Target takes it one step further by giving you visual examples of those simplified choices.

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3>Realtor</h3>
            <a href="https://www.realtor.com/">realtor.com</a>
            <picture>

            </picture>
            <p>  Fitt's Law is the concept that the smaller the link or the further the distance 
                 to the link, the longer it takes to click the link. And unclicked links can mean less traffic on the site. 
                 Once you chose your location and filter your search an interesting representation of Fitt's law pops
                 up on the Realtor website. The first thing you notice about the individual listings tends to be the 
                 photo of the home. It's their equivalent of curb appeal.  You're looking at the photo, it is the biggest
                 part of the listing, and so, it is also the link to the individual listing. You click the photo and you are 
                 taken to the page that gives you the rest of the information you may be looking for. Including a way to contact 
                 the Realtor.
